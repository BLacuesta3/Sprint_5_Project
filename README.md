Project Title: Sprint 5 Project/ Integrated Project 1 

Project Description: 
   In this integrated project, I have used Exploratory Data Analysis in order to help the online store, 'Ice'
(hypothetical company) identify patterns that can determine whether the company's games can succeed or not.  This project
involved analyzing information about the company such as: user and expert reviews, genres, and platforms (ex: XBox, Playstation, etc,)
in order to make conclusions about patterns or trends that can be determined through company sales information.  The dataset is based
on past information that dates back to the year, 2016.  In order to examine the data for the 'Ice' company, I have used various charts 
and plots such as: bar charts, boxplots, and histograms to display various distributions and statstics present in the dataset. 

Project Dataframe: 'games (8).csv' 

Project Tools And Libraries Used:

* pandas
  
* numpy
  
* random
  
* matplotlib
  
* scipy (module: stats)
  
* scipy.stats (function: pearsonr)

* seaborn

Project Methodology:

1) Importing The Necessary Libraries

2) Reading/ Uploading The Project Dataframe

3) Data Cleaning/ Data Preprocessing

4) Solving/ Answering Data Analysis Task: Look at how many games were released in different years. Is the data for every period significant?
    (Seaborn histogram used to solve this task.)

5) Solving/ Answering Data Analysis Task: Look at how sales varied from platform to platform.
   Choose the platforms with the greatest total sales and build a distribution based on data for each year.
   (Seaborn bar plot used to solve this task.)
7)
